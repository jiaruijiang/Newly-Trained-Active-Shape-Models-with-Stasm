# Real-time Eye and Head Pose Detection Using Active Shape Models with Stasm
This is my M.Eng project in the University of Toronto. 
In this project, a new active shape model with 194 landmarks is trained on Helen Dataset. This model is based on Stasm, but the experiment shows it is accurate than Stasm. Two C++ windows applications are created based on the active shape model. One detects closed eye and rotated head, and another one analyzes pupil locations to estimate gaze direction on the screen, monitoring the userâ€™s reading habits.
